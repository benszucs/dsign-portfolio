				  		<h1>About Dom</h1>
				  			<p>Hello there, I am an aspiring Graphic Designer currently in my final year at Arts University Bournemouth. I have been pursuing this passion of mine from a very early age having unlocked the secrets and possibilites that lie within Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator by the age of fourteen, and since then broadening my skillset through different mediums of design, such as Photography, 3D Modelling, Sculpturing, Architecture and more. Over the years I have grown and matured as a designer however my attention to detail has never wavered in order to bring the best out of my work.<br></br>I have over seven years of educational and self taught experience in predominantly Graphic Design, from GCSE’s to my Bachelor’s Degree I have been on this path and I plan to go a lot further. One of my favourite aspects to design is typography and lettering, deeply inspired by the likes of Seb Lester, Neville Brody, Wim Crouwel and Stefan Sagmeister with how they edit, break up and puzzle together type in such beautiful forms. Please do not hesitate to get in contact if you have any questions about my work, myself or if you would like to work with me.</p>

			<h1>DESK TOUR</h1>
			<p>Here you can have a peak at my work station, what I keep by my side whilst I do my work. I like leathers and browns when it comes to my work station, the natural tactile material compliments the technology, and creates a more personal atmosphere for me.</p>

			<img src="img/book.png" alt="" class="items grow-small hover" id="book" hinttext="My leather bound book goes with me everywhere, it is my sketchbook, my shopping list, my secret keeper. It is a sacred place where all my ideas first pass through before developing further.">
			<img src="img/wacom.png" alt="" class="items grow-small hover" id="wacom" hinttext="Wacom Bamboo Pen & Touch 2012 model I have had since 2013 and has been the most useful tool in my entire time of designing. The more I mature as a designer, the more I am able to manipulate the power it provides to a designer.">
			<img src="img/macbook.png" alt="" class="items grow-small hover" id="macbook" hinttext="My MacBook 15'' 2016 model is where all of my digital work is produced.">
			<img src="img/iphone.png" alt="" class="items grow-small hover" id="iphone" hinttext="Follow me on Instagram @ds.ign">
			<img src="img/controller.png" alt="" class="items grow-small hover" id="controller" hinttext="Occasionally I like to turn off from the real world and get lost in a game, mainly to experience some amazing work by game developers with the physics they are able to create and how it works, and occasionally look to try and break it, see if I can find a fault in the physics">
			<img src="img/apple.png" alt="" class="items grow-small hover" id="apple" hinttext="This is a representation of my passion for technology and the ease it brings to one's life. Especially the Apple ecosystem with how their products inter-link to become a vital part to one's daily routines. In the near future I plan to get familiar with Xcode and Swift and get into developing iOS applications.">
			<img src="img/guitar.png" alt="" class="items grow-small hover" id="guitar" hinttext="My Fender 3/4 acoustic is a good distraction when stressed or when trying to think of an idea. On and off for the past ten years I have self taught myself guitar, these days I really enjoy playing finger-style as well as some twelve-bar blues, for example Stevie Ray-Vaughan. I also play the drums.">
			<img src="img/dspen.png" alt="" class="items grow-small hover" id="dspen" hinttext="Where I do not do as much still life drawing or painting, I try to keep my free hand art alive through hand-lettering and calligraphy. I really like cursive writing and how the styling can emphasize or contradict a message.">
			<img src="img/vinyl.png" alt="" class="items grow-small hover" id="vinyl" hinttext="One of my biggest passions is music, next to design I have always been really into sound. Could be any genre but if theres an aspect to the sound I really enjoy then I will like that type of music. More so if I like the album I will get it on vinyl because every element to the sound is so much warmer and clearer, I find I enjoy the music more through vinyl.">
