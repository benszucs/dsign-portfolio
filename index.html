					<p class="float-me">I COMPLETED THIS BRIEF AS ONE OF THE ENTRIES FOR THE RSA STUDENT DESIGN AWARDS 2018. FOR THIS BRIEF I WAS REQUIRED TO TACKLE A MODERN ISSUE WHICH IS MORE GENERATIONS LIVING UNDER ONE ROOF. I WAS TO DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE A MODEL OF MY CONCEPT, WHICH I DID USING ACRYLIC PLASTIC CUT ON A LASER CUTTER.</p>

					<p class="float-me">Democratic trends and property prices being on the rise means that more and more families are encouraged to live together, and increasingly multiple generations in the same house. The kitchen is a social space where the family share moments and emotional experiences. With modern technologies brings the opportunity for creative design to re-imagine how we use the kitchen as a family.</p>
					<p class="float-me">With DS Kitchens you are able to re-arrange, rotate, re-order and simply transform your kitchen whenever you want. With three units magnetically snapping together you are able to make a standard height counter top of 90cm tall.  From young to old, whether able bodied or disabled, there are many different layouts you can experiment with to make your kitchen ideal for any size family.</p>
					<p class="float-me">The kitchen can pack down to be quite a space preserving unit so it can be really suitable for those with a smaller room as a kitchen. However those with larger kitchen space can explore the possibilities much further. Thanks to the magnets at each corner of every unit, not only does it snap together with ease, but you can stack them in a large number of variations.</p>

							</ul>

								<li>With modern technologies such as the induction hob, the stove can be just as mobile as the rest of the kitchen. With it only needing a connection to a power outlet to work, this layout could be transformed to suit a disabled person.</li>
								<li>Maximised space use allows for a lot of storage space from just a couple of drawers.</li>
							</ul>
							<ul class="float-me">
								<li>With the help of physics, the magnets not only allow for a quick seamless assembly but also stops the user from ever assembling it the wrong way.</li>
								<li>There are no limits in how this kitchen can be arranged, from a very small compact kitchen, the same amount of units can transform into some rather aesthetic and minimalist layouts.</li>

					<p>Bacardi tie in most of their activation to music and events such as festivals during the summer where you have young adults being free having a good time. How could Bacardi become more of a year round drink?</p>
					<p>The aim is to bring more attention to the brand in new and exciting campaigns whilst maintaining the Bacardi look and feel, that 150 years of heritage lives on.</p>

						<p>Music is the number one shared experience, it is that one thing that everyone can enjoy together. A person’s music taste can say a lot about them, and when it comes to first impressions you would not want to give a wrong one. Through a simple hyper-link to Spotify we could have people connecting on whole new levels when coming to meet that special someone. </p>
						<p>Today all you have to do is swipe right and you may have found the one, but this process can be long and daunting so how could we encourage sociability and get people to start conversations with each other? Through interaction. By putting a green button right onto someone’s profile,  within seconds you could be listening to their favourite track, enjoy a piece of their personality, that is what Bacardi want to capture.</p>

						<p>That is why the customisable portrait frames provide a great setting for the type of person you are connecting with. For example the way that you can choose the colour of your frame to be the same  as the album cover of your favourite song, it shows you are passionate about what you believe in and shows dedication and determination, some good traits.  The guy in the top-left seems like a man who enjoys a rather luxurious lifestyle with the way he used the Bacardi bat pattern as a background rather than a frame, and the guy in the bottom-right has some true dedication to Kanye West by having the same colour frame as the album cover.</p>

			<p>The Community Camera was a social experiment aimed at bringing the community together without making them get together and attend a social event. The film camera cased inside a shell, so it cannot be removed, sits on a stand and people come up and pose behind the frame while a friend takes a photo, and that is all there is to it. The results and feedback we got from this experiment was beyond what we expected.</p>

				<p class="float-me">We had over two reels of film filled with peoples’ photographs from two different locations which we hung on a plaque and hanged it from the frame for the community to see.

Anyone walking past it that noticed it would have been intrigued in what the message had to say, and hopefully they listened.</p>

				<p class="float-me">We analysed Poole high street and its social situation. We found that a lot of the civilians there were elderly or disabled, and the shops and buildings were either broken down or abandoned completely, generally not creating a great atmosphere. We looked for the cause of this negative atmosphere and looked for a solution for this issue.</p>
				<p class="float-me">We found the courtyard was filled with large walls that had lamps coming out of them, people used this as an area to sit, however the level was too high creating a really uncomfortable experience for the user. So through conceptualisation and 3D modelling I transformed the courtyard into a social space where people can all sit down and relax.</p>

For this room we developed a series of colours fading between each other, this was done in the order that resembles the mood of the campus throughout the day; Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red, these findings were researched and recorded according to what students felt like from morning to evening.</p>
					<p class="float-me">This concept was set up on a projector aimed at a set of white chairs next to white walls. We chose everything to be white so it reflects the colours a lot better and soaks it up. It represents a space, a room where students can go at any time of the day and the colour tint in the room match the time of day, so it fits well with what mood you are most likely to be feeling.</p>

					<p class="float-me">The railing system is colour coded as well as texturised to that it can be as distinguishable as possible for the user and helps point the way.  Through sketch work, and physical modelling we conceptualised the system. Later taking to Google SketchUp I quickly visualised it in three dimensional digital space.</p>

			<p>HERE IS A COLLECTION OF SIGNIFICANT PHOTO EDITS I HAVE DONE IN THE RECENT PAST, AND SOME THAT I DID MANY YEARS AGO. ONE OF THESE EDITS DATE BACK TO JULY 2013, AT THE TIME, I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD, WHEN I BOUGHT MY FIRST GRAPHICS TABLET AND I STARTED GETTING INTO PHOTO MANIPULATION.</p>
			<p>THIS LED ME TO GO ON TO STUDYING PHOTOGRAPHY IN COLLEGE AND LEARNING THE CAMERA, FROM LOADING THE FILM, TO PREPARING THE NEGATIVE IN THE DARK ROOM, TO EXPOSING THE NEGATIVE ONTO PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPER.</p>

				<p class="float-me">Everyone knows how important it is to layout your findings and insights, no matter how much you have done, unless you present it in a clear logical way, someone reading your work could get confused if the way that it is presented does not reflect clearly what your findings are.</p>
				<p class="float-me">Here I have my research boards for the D&AD New Blood Awards 2018 Bacardi brief. Over the space of two days I delved deep into researching the brand identity, the target audience and did a lot of idea generation before developing a finalised outcome. The photograph is very off colour due to the dull and low lighting in my room.  Also a tutor would not be able to decipher this if I was to present it in a book. It must be shown in pieces.</p>

				<p class="float-me">I took that first photograph and chopped it up into sections. Through cutting out methods such as the “Quick Selection Tool”, “Color Range” and the “Eraser Tool”, I managed to get a pretty close look and feel of the paper being stuck right there on the screen. With the “Eraser Tool” on 30% I went over each masking tape. What this allowed me to do is have any colour background or texture and the research will still blend in to clean flat image, because the masking tape is translucent.</p>
				<p class="float-me">Through various adjustment layers such as “Levels”, “Curves”, “Hue/ Saturation” etc, I corrected the colouring as much as the photograph allowed, where the paper is still yellow and colours are very off, it is nevertheless much easier on the eyes it not being so yellow.  Also the bronze background colour works very nicely with the tone of the images.</p>

				<p class="float-me">There are other examples of me implementing this method to presenting research, I feel it is a very clear and understandable way to lay out findings.</p>

				<p class="float-me">The secret about this project is it took all day to do, to get the perspective right, the letters to all be the same size it was tedious and the shapes we were working with made it very hard to do it right. As a matter of fact it took so long that we lost the daylight and we ran out of tape at the end. This left the project incomplete. However that did not stop me from completing the piece using other means.</p>
				<p class="float-me">Can you guess which letters were not done by tape but rather photoshopped on? The “COM” in “COMMUNITY”. Keeping in mind perspective, the relation between floor and wall, texture and depth, I used my Adobe knowledge to complete this project.</p>

				<p class="float-me">Here is a close up on all the letters which I completely photoshopped in. Notice the tape stretching and bending around the wheel of the bin, or the fencing giving the tape depth and texture as it runs down the ridges.</p>
				<p class="float-me">I also made general touch ups on the photo to get rid of any major imperfections so when you look at the lettering it is as correct as it can be given the circumstances.</p>

				<p class="float-me">This is one of the first full photoshopped pieces I ever did. When I first started out with my Wacom graphics tablet, I really got into photo manipulation, where these photographs are not the highest resolution you can still see how I am piecing together this photograph.</p>
				<p class="float-me">Notice the front of the nearest ship is broken off and on fire, but you can also see the reflection in the water. Little details that bring the photograph together that much more, or in the background the church tower is mid impact with a meteor and the top of it is falling down. Was really nostalgic stumbling across this piece.</p>
