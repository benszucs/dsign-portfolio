My first major project, a portfolio website for an aspiring graphics designer.

Wrote every line of code from the ground up , thus it is a very messy website as it stands.

Due to time constraints this project was rushed and could use a lot of work to be made less fragile.

Already working on a better version that will employ Bootstrap and SASS to make the website mobile friendly.
